# TelemedicineProject
A telemedicine project with video conferencing function

The server and doctor side web application is inside Server_doctorside_WebAPP. (Django backend with Javascript, Jquery frontend)
The patient side mobile application is inside PatientSide_mobileAPP. (react-native APP)
The Video conferencing function is provided by Twilio.

There are readme in each folder, see them for more information.
The Report.pdf is a report about this system, read this if you want to know what does this system look like without running it by yourself.

Note: This Repo won't actually run since I have removed my Twilio username and password from it, you can read the Report.pdf to see its running effect.
